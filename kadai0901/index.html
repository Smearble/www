    <h1>Box Design Practice</h1>
    <div class="box box1">
        <h2>Box 1</h2>
        <p>
            This is the first box. It has a light blue background,
            rounded corners, and a solid border. This box includes
            an image below to enhance the visual appeal of the content.
            The image should be relevant to the content described and 
            help illustrate the point.
        </p>
        <img src="img/box1.jpg">
    </div>
    <div class="box box2">
        <h2>Box 2</h2>
        <p>
            This is the second box. It has a light orange background.
            slightly rounded corners, a solid border, and a shadow.
            Including an image in this box helps break up the text and 
            provides a visual example of the content. The use of CSS box
            shadow enhances the 3D effect of this box.

    <div class="box box3">
        <h2>Box 3</h2>
        <p>
            This is third box. It has light purple background,
            no rounded corners, and a dashed border. This box also
            includes an image, which helps to demonstrate how different
            styles and borders can be applied to create distinct
            visual sections withis a webpage.
